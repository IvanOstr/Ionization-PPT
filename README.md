Ionization rate in EM field PPT formulation

I've used A.14 formula in the paper ["Ultrashort filaments of light in weakly-ionized, optically-transparent media"][1] to calculate the dependence of ionization rate in oxygen molecules in air on laser intensity.
I'm interested in comparing it with the famous sigma_k*I**k law of MPI ionization. 

I think Z_eff should be between 0 and 1.
